# WordPress Plugin Attestation Action

Do you use GitHub Actions to build and deploy your plugin to the WordPress.org plugin directory? If so, add this action to your workflow to generate a build provenance attestion for the ZIP file that is served by WordPress.org.

This action works particularly well with the WordPress.org Plugin Deploy action from 10up, but it will work with any workflow which generates a ZIP file of your plugin.
