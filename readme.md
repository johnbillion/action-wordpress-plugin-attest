# WordPress.org Plugin Attestation Action

Do you use GitHub Actions to build and deploy your plugin to WordPress.org? If so, this action can added to your workflow in order to generate a build provenance attestion for the ZIP file that is served by WordPress.org once your new version is released.

It works particularly smoothly with the WordPress.org Plugin Deploy action from 10up, but it will work with any workflow which can or does generate a ZIP file of your plugin.
